Brief description of your project’s purpose and functionality:

Our projects main goal was to show the user their horoscope. However we realized we needed to make it more of a game,
so we had the idea to make 2 mini games related to the persons zodiac sign. 

Game 1; Personality Match: The personality match allows the user to enter their zodiac sign and what gender personality
match they would like to see(Male, Female or Random if they would like to be surprised). And of course all of these famous people
have the same zodiac sign as you! 

Game 2; Love Compatibility: Do you want to know if you and another zodiac sign are compatible? Try playing our love
compatibility game. After the user has chosen 2 zodiac signs, they click a button to find out what percent of 
compatibility they have.
